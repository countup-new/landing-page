          <h2>What is CountUp?</h2>
          <div class="faq-answer hidden">
            <p>
              At one point or another, pretty much every startup needs to speak with an accountant. Current accounting solutions are great for recording data but you need a good accountant to guide you through important business decisions.
            </p>
            <p>
              Hiring the right accountant can be a tough process, it can be expensive and take a lot of time and resources to engage appropriate professionals for your specific needs.
            </p>
            <p>
              “With any kind of specialist, a CPA or an accountant or a lawyer, it's always best to use people who are used to dealing with startups. Not your aunt who lives in Minnesota and doesn't actually know how startups work.” - Kirsty Nathoo YCombinator Startup Class.
            </p>
            <p>
              CountUp.io is a free platform for entrepreneurs to find and work with accountants specifically curated for startups. Just input your required services and get matched with a licensed accountant who will handle it for you. Use our encrypted platform to manage your projects and have 24/7 access to your accountant.

        <div class="faq-question">
          <h2>Is CountUp an accounting firm?</h2>
          <div class="faq-answer hidden">
            <p>
              CountUp is not an accounting firm – we don’t provide accounting services but independent accountants in our network do. We pair customers with appropriate accountants for their needs and provide online collaboration tools to streamline the engagement process.
            </p>

        <div class="faq-question">
          <h2>What is the difference between CountUp and a traditional accounting firm?</h2>
          <div class="faq-answer hidden">
            <p>
              Traditional ‘brick & mortar’ accounting firms pay extra for prime office locations and partner fees. CountUp eliminates both, saving you 60%. Work directly with high quality accountants online. Drop the inflated accounting firm hourly rates, physical visits to 'brick & mortar' locations, and wasted time searching on your own.

        <div class="faq-question">
          <h2>What is the difference between CountUp and Accounting Software like QuickBooks/Xero/Freshbooks?</h2>
          <div class="faq-answer hidden">
            <p>
              Accounting software solutions are great for recording your data but you need a good accountant to make use of that data and guide you through important business decisions. CountUp provides collaborations tools to help you find and work with your dedicated accountant online.
            </p>
            <p>
              Participating accountants help you automate most of your accounting tasks using the most appropriate software for your business. Use our encrypted platform to manage your accountant engagement, accounting data and have 24/7 access to your dedicated accountant.
            </p>
            <p>
              Instead of hiring a full-time accountant, your dedicated CountUp Accountant can handle all of your bookkeeping, taxes, payroll, and performance tracking for a flat monthly fee.

          <h2>What is the difference between CountUp and typical freelance marketplaces like Upwork/Guru/Freelancer?</h2>
          <div class="faq-answer hidden">
            <p>
              The classic marketplace model is: submit a request for a job, get 10-15 proposals from strangers, pick one and hope they do a good job. These marketplaces are very general and are not focused on any industry or specialist niches. CountUp solely focuses on startups AND accountants.

          <h2>Are these quality accounting services?</h2>
          <div class="faq-answer hidden">
            <p>
              We personally review and curate every accountant on the platform for proper certifications, malpractice insurance, and a minimum of four years’ experience. Experts in our network range from financial executives, top MBAs, former Big 4 CPAs, and analysts from leading companies. They can help with anything from taxes, payroll, bookkeeping, and incorporation to budgeting, valuations, fundraising and CFO services. CountUp is having the access to a firm with an endless supply of top on-demand accounting talent, minus the massive overhead cost associated.

          <h2>How do I get started?</h2>
          <div class="faq-answer hidden">
            <p>
              Get started with a free CountUp Account which gives you access to all of our online collaboration tools. Answer a few questions to help us match you with the most appropriate accountant. Your accountant will reach out to you with a personalized tip and an estimated price quote. Chat to find out more info, share files, and accept when you are ready. We’ll be here every step of the way to make sure it’s a smooth process for both sides. Once the work is completed, you’ll have a chance to review everything.

          <h2>Is there a money back guarantee?</h2>
          <div class="faq-answer hidden">
            <p>
              Yes, all projects on CountUp come with a guarantee. Your money is released only when you approve the final work product. If the work is not the same as represented in the project, the money will be returned to you.

        <h2>5. Gathering and protecting the information we collect <br>Industry standards in data security: </h2>
        <p>
          CountUp takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect User Personal Information from unauthorized access, alteration, or destruction; maintain data accuracy; and help ensure the appropriate use of User Personal Information. We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the User Personal Information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
        </p>
        <h2>No responsibility for third party service providers’ security: </h2>
        <p>
          In addition, while we take measures reasonably necessary to ensure that our third party service providers, such as our payment processing and data tracking, re-targeting or data analysis services, keep your information secure, these organizations' practices are ultimately beyond our control. By using our Service, you acknowledge that you understand and agree to assume these risks.
        </p>
        <h2>Documents, in general: </h2>
        <p>
          CountUp uses third party service providers to transmit, store, encrypt, process and display uploaded documents on our behalf. CountUp has taken measures reasonably necessary to ensure that these services keep uploaded documents private and secure, but these organizations practices are ultimately beyond our control. By using the documents feature, you acknowledge that you understand and agree to assume the risks. Some of our service providers include:
        </p>
        <p>
          -Amazon Web Services (web hosting)
        </p>
        <p>
          -Stripe (payments)
        </p>
        <h2>International data transfer: </h2>
        <p>

By using the Service, you agree that we can store, process and transfer your information in this manner.
        </p>
        <h2>6. Compelled Disclosure</h2>
        <p>
          CountUp discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when we believe in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of CountUp, third parties, or the public at large.
        </p>
        <p>
          In complying with court orders and similar legal processes, CountUp strives for transparency. When permitted, we will make a reasonable effort to notify Users of such disclosure.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, if you have engaged an Accountant User through the Service (for example, by accepting a proposal and promising to pay or paying any required fees or costs), CountUp considers communications and documents shared with Consultant Users who are accountants to be privileged accountant-client communications and, to the extent legally permissible, may notify the engaged Accountant User of the subpoena, court order, or governmental request so that they may respond to the request. Furthermore, if an Accountant User has been engaged, CountUp may no longer disclose information on a “good faith” belief.
        </p>
        <h2>7. Your access to and control of the information we collect <br> Access to User Information: </h2>
        <p>

        <p>
          b. CountUp Is Not An Accountant Referral Service. CountUp is not an accountant referral service. CountUp does not select or endorse any individual Accountant User to service a User. While CountUp uses commercially reasonable efforts to verify that our registered Accountant Users are licensed accountants (i.e., Certified Public Accountants Users), we do not make any warranty, guarantee, or representation as to the accounting ability, competence, quality, or qualifications of any Accountant User, whether a registered or Certified Public Accountants Users. You are strongly advised to perform your own investigation prior to selecting an Accountant User by confirming with the appropriate licensing authorities to verify listed credentials and education, and to further verify information about a particular subscribed Accountant User by confirming with the accountant’s office, the state AICPA, FASB and NASBA associations. CountUp does not warrant or guarantee that Accountant Users are covered by professional liability insurance or malpractice insurance. CountUp encourages Accounting Clients to research any Accountant User before accepting professional advice.
        </p>
        <p>
          c. CountUp does not vouch for any of its Users. Providing a service where potential clients and accounting professionals can meet does not imply an endorsement of any subscribing accountant or service provider. CountUp does not sanction statements an accountant may post on the system. CountUp makes no representation concerning the qualifications of non-accounting service providers.
        </p>
        <p>

CountUp will have no responsibility or liability of any kind for any User-Generated Content or accounting advice or financial advice you encounter on or through the Website, and any use or reliance on User-Generated Content or accounting advice or financial advice is solely at your own risk. We have no control over, and cannot guarantee the availability of any Accountant User at any particular time. We will not be liable for cancelled or otherwise unfulfilled appointments or any injury resulting therefrom, or for any other injury resulting from the use of the Website or Services whatsoever.
        </p>
        <p>
          e. Use of CountUp Does Not Create An Accountant-Client Relationship With CountUp. CountUp does not offer accounting advice or services.

If you submit an accounting related question or service request to CountUp, answers are (i) provided by independent accounting professionals and organizations, (ii) for informational purposes only, and (iii) do not establish any accountant-client relationship.
        </p>

        <h2>6. Accountant Users. </h2>
        <p>
          Accountant Users are independent accounting professionals who offer to perform accounting services for prospective Accounting Clients. They are not employees of CountUp.
        </p>
        <p>
          a. No Accountant-Client Relationship through Website Use. Use of the CountUp Website may not form an accountant-client relationship with Accountant Users. Information posted publicly on the Website; or information sent in an unsolicited message to a User is not intended as accounting or financial advice, is not confidential, and does not create an accountant-client relationship. It is considered User-Generated Content.
        </p>
        <p>
          b. Accountant-Client Relationship through Service Use. An accountant-client relationship may be formed through the use of the Service between Users and Accountant Users only. Accounting Clients may post Jobs through the Service. Accountant Users may submit Bids and negotiate details of these Jobs prior to acceptance. Upon acceptance, the scope of an Accountant User’s engagement is strictly limited to the matter agreed upon in the Bid unless Accounting Client and Accountant User subsequently formalize their arrangement via a signed engagement letter or other written agreement, in which case the most recent written agreement would take precedence over a previously accepted proposal. A Bid is not a substitute for an in-person or telephone consultation with an accountant licensed to practice in your jurisdiction about your specific accounting service or issue, and you should not rely upon information contained in a Bid as accounting advice. CountUp takes every reasonable effort including but not limited to non-disclosure agreement, terms of service and privacy policy, which Accountant Users acknowledge, to ensure confidentiality but we cannot guarantee it.
        </p>
        <p>
          c. User Responsibilities. Accountant Users are solely responsible for ensuring that any information, solicitations, or advertisements they post or place on the Website, including without limitation User-Generated Content, and any communications they may have with prospective clients through the Website or the Service, fully comply with all applicable laws and rules of professional conduct, including those concerning the unauthorized practice of accounting and those regulating the form, manner or content of communications with clients, advertising, or other matters.
        </p>
        <p>
          d. Payment of Accountant Users. Certain specific terms govern Accountant Users and payment.
        </p>
        <p>
          i. CountUp Is Not A Party To Contracts. Accounting Clients may contract with Accountant Users through posting and acceptance of Jobs. Such contracts are solely between the Accounting Client and the Accountant User. CountUp will not be a party to any contracts for Jobs submitted through our Service, unless posted by a CountUp officer. CountUp facilitates these contracts by supplying a platform for communication management and payment tools.
        </p>
        <p>
          ii. All Accounting Fees Are Paid To Accountant Users. CountUp does neither provide nor charge for accounting services. CountUp may charge a transaction fee for each Job facilitated by CountUp in exchange for the services CountUp provides to our Users
        </p>

        <h2>12. Payment and Transactions.</h2>
        <p>
          a. Payment Process. Payment will be process using Accounting Client's credit card, debit card or bank account, as specified in the proposal and/or invoice and agreed upon by the Accounting Client and the Accountant User. When a Job (or a segment thereof as pre-agreed in writing by the Accounting Client and the Accountant User) is marked as completed by the Accountant User, CountUp will inform the Accounting Client that the Job (or a segment thereof as pre-agreed in writing by the Accounting Client and the Accountant User) is complete. The Accounting Client must then mark the agreed-upon amount complete or request changes. If the Accounting Client has taken no action after 10 business days, CountUp will have the right to charge the Accounting Client's credit card or bank account for the full amount of the agreed-upon fee or undisputed invoice, in addition to CountUp’s processing fee, if any. The Accounting Client may submit disputes over payment to orders@CountUp.io provided that he or she adheres to the other conditions set forth in Section 14 (Accounting Client-Accountant User Dispute Resolution Procedures).
        </p>
        <p>
          b. Responsibility for Payment. You are responsible for all fees, including taxes, associated with your use of the Service. By using the Service, you agree to pay the Accountant User through CountUp the amount agreed on in the Bid or undisputed invoice, unless you dispute the matter by sending an email to orders@CountUp.io and adhere to the other conditions set forth in Section 14 (Accounting Client-Accountant User Dispute Resolution Procedures). You are responsible for providing us with a valid means of payment.
        </p>
        <p>
          c. CountUp’s Responsibility. CountUp agrees to present you with a full invoice of each charge in advance of charging your credit card, debit card or bank account. CountUp agrees to pay the applicable Accountant User the amount received, less CountUp’s processing fee, if any.
        </p>
        <p>
          d. Payment Authorization. By agreeing to these terms, you are giving CountUp permission to charge your on-file credit card, debit card, bank account, or other approved methods of payment for fees that you authorize CountUp to satisfy. Depending on your Bid specifications, CountUp may charge you on a one-time or recurring basis. You authorize CountUp to charge you the full amount owed to any Accountant User via the Service, as well as CountUp’s processing fee, if any. For the avoidance of doubt, in the event that in a particular instance a Accountant User only uses the Services to invoice you for accounting services other than those which are the subject of a Bid, by placing your credit card, debit card or bank account on file with CountUp or our third party payment processor, you acknowledge and agree that the payment terms set forth in this Section 12 shall apply.
        </p>
        <p>
          e. Processing Fee Authorization.  An applicable processing fee may be applied to payments to Accountant Users prior to deposit in their bank account.

        </p>
        <h2>13. Verified Accountant User Limited Payment Guarantee. </h2>
        <p>
          CountUp guarantees the payment of each Verified Accountant User’s invoice for the completion of Jobs (or a segment thereof as pre-agreed in writing by the Accounting Client and the Accountant User) for Accounting Clients (CountUp’s “Limited Payment Guarantee”), subject to the following terms and conditions (the “Limited Payment Guarantee Conditions”):
        </p>
        <p>
          a. The Accounting Client has failed to mark the project complete and satisfy the Verified Accountant User’s invoice (the dollar amount of such invoice, the “Unpaid Invoiced Amount”) by the end of the tenth (10th) calendar day after the invoice has been submitted (such date, the “Accounting Client Payment Due Date”).
        </p>
        <p>
          b. The Verified Accountant User has submitted to CountUp a written claim for the Unpaid Invoiced Amount (i) within a twenty-one (21) calendar day period, beginning on the day immediately following the Accounting Client Payment Due Date (such period, the “Verified Accountant User Claim Submission Period”) and (ii) provide in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances of the Job, including any rationale provided by the Accounting Client for his/her failure to make such payment and/or any rationale the accountant can in good faith speculate on as to why client refuses to make payment (such claim, a “Limited Payment Guarantee Request”). Failure to submit the Limited Payment Guarantee Request within the Verified Accountant User Claim Submission Period shall constitute such Accountant User’s permanent waiver of his or her right to receive the Unpaid Invoiced Amount from any person or entity, including CountUp and the Accounting Client. To the extent that CountUp determines in its sole and absolute discretion that it is commercially reasonable to do so, it may continue its collection efforts with the Accounting Client and if successful, the Verified Accountant User will receive his/her portion of the collected amount, minus any reasonable CountUp out-of-pocket collection expenses, pursuant to 12.e above.
        </p>
        <p>
          c. In the event that the Verified Accountant User does submit a Limited Payment Guarantee Request within the Verified Accountant User Claim Submission Period, and such request contains the information set forth in clause 13.b. above, CountUp will attempt in good faith to work with the Accounting Client and Verified Accountant User for a period of up to seven (7) calendar days from the date of the Limited Payment Guarantee Request (such period, the “Payment-Related Disputed Matter Mediation Period”) to resolve the matter which is the subject of the Limited Payment Guarantee Request (the “Payment-Related Disputed Matter”). In the event that the Payment-Related Disputed Matter is successfully resolved within the Payment-Related Disputed Matter Mediation Period, each of the Accounting Client, Verified Accountant User and, if relevant, CountUp will take the agreed upon steps to execute the agreed-upon resolution.
        </p>
        <p>
          d. In the event that the Payment-Related Disputed Matter remains unresolved at the conclusion of the Payment-Related Disputed Matter Mediation Period, by no later than the seventh (7th) calendar day after the end of the Payment-Related Disputed Matter Mediation Period (the date such determination is communicated in writing to the Accounting Client and Verified User Accountant, the “CountUp Disputed-Amount Determination Date”), CountUp shall make a determination in its sole and absolute discretion (the “CountUp Disputed Matter Decision”), based upon the information theretofore provided by Verified Accountant User and, if provided, the Accounting Client, as to whether the nature and quality of the accounting services rendered in connection with the related Job are consistent with industry standards, the provisions of the related Bid and these Terms and Conditions. Should CountUp decide the Payment-Related Disputed Matter in favor of the Verified Accountant User, CountUp shall remit the Unpaid Invoiced Amount to the Verified Accountant User within seven (7) calendar days after the CountUp Disputed-Amount Determination Date, and the Verified Accountant User shall be deemed to have assigned all of his or her rights with respect to the Payment-Related Disputed Matter to CountUp. Notwithstanding anything stated herein or otherwise to the contrary, the dollar amount sought under this Section 13 shall not exceed the amount initially contracted between Accounting Client and Verified Accountant User in relation to the Job or an amount subsequently agreed to in a signed engagement letter or other written agreement between the parties, and in any event shall never exceed $5,000 in aggregate across all unpaid invoices sent by the Verified Accountant User to the Accounting Client.
        </p>
        <p>
          e. Should CountUp decide the Payment-Related Disputed Matter in favor of the Accounting Client, the Accounting Client shall no longer be obligated to make payment of the Unpaid Invoiced Amount to the Verified Accountant User and shall be deemed to have assigned all of his or her rights with respect to the Payment-Related Disputed Matter to CountUp as of the CountUp Disputed-Amount Determination Date. In such event, the Verified Accountant User shall (i) be deemed to have waived his or her rights to seek such amounts from the Accounting Client, and (ii) have the right to initiate binding arbitration proceedings with respect to the Unpaid Invoiced Amount against CountUp which are equivalent to those proceedings set forth in Section 20.d. hereof (Arbitration) by providing CountUp with written notice of his or her exercise of such right within ten (10) calendar days after the end of the CountUp Disputed-Amount Determination Date (such period, the “Payment-Dispute Arbitration Election Time Period”). In the event that the Verified Accountant User does not exercise his or her right to initiate arbitration proceedings during the Payment Dispute Arbitration Election Time Period, he or she shall be deemed to have permanently waived his or her right to payment of the Unpaid Invoiced Amount.
        </p>
        <h2>14. Accounting Client-Verified Accountant User Dispute Resolution Procedures. </h2>
        <p>
          In the event that an Accounting Client has a good faith belief that the nature or quality of the accounting services rendered by a Verified Accountant User in connection with the relevant Job are not consistent with industry standards or the provisions of the related Bid or these Terms and Conditions, or the amounts invoiced for the accounting services provided by such Accountant User are not consistent with such Bid (such matter, a “Services-Related Disputed Matter”), he or she shall be permitted to withhold payment of any disputed amounts which are the subject of such matter (the “Withheld Payment Amounts”), subject to the following terms and conditions (the “Withheld Payment Amount Conditions”):
        </p>
        <p>
          a. Within ten (10) calendar days of the date of the related invoice (such period, the “Accounting Client Dispute Notice Period”), the Accounting Client shall provide written notice to CountUp setting forth in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances which are the basis of the Services-Related Disputed Matter (each, a “Services-Related Dispute Notice”). The Accounting Client’s failure to submit a Services-Related Dispute Notice within the Accounting Client Dispute Notice Period shall constitute such Accounting Client’s permanent waiver of his or her right to dispute the Withheld Payment Amounts, which amounts will be charged to the Accounting Client’s on-file credit card, debit card, bank account, or other approved methods of payment in accordance with Section 12.d. of these Terms of Use.
        </p>
        <p>
          b. In the event that the Accounting Client does submit a Services-Related Dispute Notice within the Accounting Client Dispute Notice Period, and such request contains the information set forth in clause 14.a. above, CountUp will attempt in good faith to work with the Accounting Client and Verified Accountant User for a period of up to fifteen (15) calendar days from the date of the Services-Related Dispute Notice (such period, the “Services-Related Disputed Matter Mediation Period”) to resolve the Services-Related Disputed Matter. In the event that the Services-Related Disputed Matter is successfully resolved within the Services-Related Disputed Matter Mediation Period, each of the Accounting Client, Verified Accountant User and, if relevant, CountUp will take the agreed upon steps to execute the agreed-upon resolution.
        </p>
        <p>
          c. In the event that the Services-Related Disputed Matter remains unresolved at the conclusion of the Services-Related Disputed Matter Mediation Period, by no later than the fourteenth (14th) calendar day after the end of the Services-Related Disputed Matter Mediation Period, CountUp shall make a determination in its sole and absolute discretion (the “CountUp Services-Related Disputed Matter Decision”), and based upon the information theretofore provided by the Accounting Client and Verified Accountant User, as to whether the nature and quality of the accounting services rendered in connection with the Job which is the subject of the Services-Related Disputed Matter were consistent with industry standards, the provisions of the related Bid and these Terms and Conditions. Should CountUp decide the Services-Related Disputed Matter in favor of the Verified Accountant User, the Accounting Client shall be obligated to make payment of the Withheld Payment Amounts to such Accountant User within the seven (7) calendar day period after the date on which such Accounting Client is notified in writing of the CountUp Services-Related Disputed Matter Decision (the “CountUp Services-Related Disputed Matter Decision Notice”). In the event that the Accounting Client fails to make timely payment, CountUp will remit the Withheld Payment Amounts to the Verified Accountant User who will assign his or her rights to reimbursement for such amounts to CountUp which may, in its sole discretion, process payment pursuant to Section 12.d and/or elect to pursue its rights and remedies against the Accounting Client.
        </p>
        <p>
          d. Should CountUp decide the Services-Related Disputed Matter in favor of the Accounting Client, the Accounting Client shall no longer be obligated to make payment of the Withheld Payment Amounts to the Verified Accountant User and shall be deemed to have assigned all of his or her rights with respect to the Services-Related Disputed Matter to CountUp. In such event, the Verified Accountant User shall (i) be deemed to have waived his or her rights to seek such amounts from the Accounting Client, and (ii) have the right to initiate binding arbitration proceedings with respect to the Withheld Payment Amounts against CountUp which are equivalent to those proceedings set forth in Section 20.d. hereof (Arbitration) by providing CountUp with written notice of his or her exercise of such right within ten (10) calendar days after the date of the Services-Related Disputed Matter Decision Notice (such period, the “Services-Related Arbitration Election Time Period”). In the event that the Verified Accountant User does not exercise his or her right to initiate arbitration proceedings during the Services-Related Arbitration Election Time Period, he or she shall be deemed to have permanently waived his or her right to payment of the Withheld Payment Amounts.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the event that the Verified Accountant User and Accounting Client have both timely availed themselves of the rights set forth in Section 13 and Section 14, the procedures set forth in Section 14 shall take precedent over the proceedings set forth in Section 13 and the Verified User Accountant agrees to permanently waive his or her right to pursue his or her rights set forth in Section 13 with respect to the facts and circumstances underlying the Payment-Related Disputed Matter. The procedures set forth in this Section 14 shall be referred to herein as the “Alternative Dispute Resolution Procedures”.

Any failure on the part of CountUp to enforce any provision of this Agreement will not be considered a waiver of our right to enforce such provision. Our rights under this Agreement will survive any termination of this Agreement.
        </p>
        <p>
          c. Limitation of Term of Action. You agree that any cause of action related to or arising out of your relationship with CountUp must commence within ONE year after the cause of action accrues. Otherwise, such cause of action is permanently barred.
        </p>
        <p>
          d. Arbitration. Should a dispute arise between you and CountUp, we would like to provide you with a neutral and cost-effective means of resolving the dispute quickly. Therefore, for any claim (except for claims for injunctive or equitable relief or claims regarding intellectual property rights) under this Agreement , either party may elect to resolve any dispute arising under this Agreement through binding non-appearance-based arbitration. The party electing arbitration must initiate it through an established alternative dispute resolution (“ADR”) provider mutually agreed upon by the parties. The ADR provider and the parties must comply with the following rules: (a) the arbitration will be conducted, at the option of the party seeking relief, by telephone, online, or based solely on written submissions; (b) the arbitration will not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties; and (c) any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.
        </p>
        <p>

CountUp may assign or delegate these Terms of Use and/or the CountUp Privacy Policy, in whole or in part, to any person or entity at any time with or without your consent. You may not assign or delegate any rights or obligations under the Terms of Use or Privacy Policy without CountUp’s prior written consent, and any unauthorized assignment and delegation by you is void.
        </p>
        <p>
          f. Section Headings and Summaries Non-Binding. Throughout this Agreement, each section includes titles and brief summaries of the following terms and conditions. These section titles and brief summaries are not legally binding.
        </p>
        <p>

        </p>
